# Stock Price Prediction Methodology

## Overview
Our advanced prediction algorithm combines multiple technical analysis indicators with machine learning models to forecast stock price movements.

## Core Components

### Technical Analysis
- **Moving Averages**: Simple and exponential moving averages (SMA, EMA) for trend identification
- **Bollinger Bands**: Volatility-based indicators for support and resistance levels
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold conditions
- **MACD**: Moving Average Convergence Divergence for trend changes

### Machine Learning Model
- **LSTM Neural Networks**: Long Short-Term Memory networks trained on historical price data
- **Feature Engineering**: Volume, volatility, and market sentiment indicators
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combination of multiple models for improved accuracy

### Risk Assessment
- **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical bounds around predictions
- **Volatility Analysis**: Historical and implied volatility measurements
- **Market Correlation**: Cross-asset correlation analysis

## Accuracy Metrics
Our models achieve 75-85% directional accuracy on short-term predictions (1-7 days) and maintain robust performance across different market conditions.
