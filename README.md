## 🚀 Overview

**RetainAI** continuously scrapes 📈 stock prices and retrains a machine learning model while retaining previously learned data — ensuring **evolving accuracy** over time.

> ⚠️ Still in testing — works fine, just not launched yet. Feel free to pick it up and launch it!

## 🔑 Features

- 🔁 **Continuous Scraping** – Fetches stock prices at fixed daily intervals.
- 🧠 **Retention-Aware Training** – Keeps past learnings intact during retraining.
- ⚙️ **Self-Updating Model** – Evolves with each data update.
- 🎯 **Smarter Predictions** – Improves over time with fresh + historic data.
